## Population Analysis Project

This project is centered around a comprehensive analysis of global population data. The code provided performs a variety of visualizations and calculations to explore different aspects of population trends, growth rates, and distributions over time.

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file that contains global population data. The data spans from the year 1960 to 2022, covering various countries around the world.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- Seaborn: For making statistical graphics in Python.

### Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. After cloning the repository, you can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Files in the Repository

- `Prodigy Task 1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and visualizations.
- `Data Set/API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_6011311.csv`: The dataset file used in the project.

### Project Structure

The Jupyter Notebook (`Prodigy Task 1.ipynb`) contains several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of population data analysis:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading the dataset and performing initial cleaning.
2. **Global Population Trend**: Visualization of the world population from 1960 to 2022.
3. **Population Distribution Histograms**: Display of population distribution among countries for selected years.
4. **Population Trends of Top Countries**: Analysis of population trends in the top 5 populous countries in 1960.
5. **Population Growth Rate Analysis**: Calculation and visualization of population growth rates for various periods and countries.
6. **Specific Country Analysis**: A detailed population trend for a specific country (e.g., China).
7. **Additional Visualizations**: Various other insightful visualizations such as bar charts of total population by year.

### Running the Project

To view and run the project:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Prodigy Task 1.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and visualizations.
